      How many things we know about the Universe? It is hardly to answer this question. On the one hand, we aware just
      5% about our Universe structure. On the other hand, we even can’t tell precisely about this structure.
      We just have no idea! It isn't scared but makes me impressed of science moving us to understanding how our world works.
      It opened for me splendid world of physics!
    </p>
    <p>
      From my childhood I always asked questions, which didn't have answers from adults: Why does sun shine?
      Why is the sky blue? and many others. Gradually observing the surrounding world, I discover new people, who describe
      how our world works - they are physicists. All school years I was reading books by the greatest physicists such as S. Hawking or R. Feynman.
      I wondered how simply and clear authors could explain every difficult thought to reader, even for schoolboy.
      Thus, I decided to be a person, who open new horizons and describe how entire world works, I decided to be a physicist!
    </p>
    <p>
      Already being at a university, I faced to the main problem is to misunderstanding so difficult and dreary subjects for many my classmates.
      In the beginning I didn’t notice but many of them asked me for receiving clarifications and when we revised to exams I helped them.
      After that they were thankful for the accessible explanation of difficult things. Then I found out my vocation is not only
      move boundaries of the Universe further but also make things easier, explain so that everyone could understand modern physics!
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly at school, when I don’t think about my science future, my physics’ teacher after class told me:
      «You will never become a real scientist! You don’t have enough capabilities to understand  physics’ laws!»
      It hurts my feelings so much. I decided to prove to her and, first of all, prove myself, that I will be able to become a physicist.
      Nowadays, on the senior year and so close to my bachelor’s degree in physics, I completely understand that every person
      should make his own decision about way leading to future. In my opinion, the main thing is to believe and put enormous
      efforts to achieve many aims in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unofficial title of my bachelor's course is 'Astrophysics: from stars to boundaries of the Universe'.
      Due to this course I've definitely got many things and knowledges, which help to describe every process in the world.
      To return to the beginning, what is beyond boundaries of our understanding? We have no idea! It gives my life meaning to
      continue research until I find every answer!
